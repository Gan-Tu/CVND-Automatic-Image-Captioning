    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture consists of a CNN encoder and RNN decoder. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CNN encoder is a pre-trained ResNet on ImageNet, which is a VGG convolutional neural network with skip connections. It has been proven to work really well on tasks like image recognition, because the residual connections help model the residual differences before and after the convolution with the help of the identity block. A good pre-trained network on ImageNet is already good at extracting both useful low-level and high-level features for image tasks, so it naturally serves as a feature encoder for the image we want to caption. Since we are not doing the traditional image classification task, we drop the last fully connected layer and replace it without a new trainable fully connected layer to help transform the final feature map to an encoding that are more useful for the RNN decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs have long been shown useful in language tasks due to its ability to model data with sequential nature, such as language. Specifically, LSTMs even incoporate both long term and short term information as memories in the network. Thus, we pick a RNN decoder for the captioning task. Specifically, following the spirit of sequence to sequence (seq2seq) models used in translation, we leveraged the architecture choices in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) to use a LSTM to generate captions based on the encoded information from the CNN encoder. Specifically, we first use the CNN encoder output concatenated with the \"START\" token as the initial input for the RNN decoder. We apply a fully connected layer on the hidden states at that timestamp to output a softmax probability over the words in our entire vocabulary, where we choose the word with the highest probability as the word generated at that timestamp. Then, we feed this predicted word back again as the input for the next step. We continue so until we generated a caption of max length, or the network generated the \"STOP\" token, which indicates the end of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "To choose the hyperparameters, I initially consulted [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf). I used a minimum word count threshold of **5**, an embedding size of **512** and a hidden size of **512** as well. I trained the network for 3 epochs as recommended by Udacity. When initially insepcting the loss decrease, it is decreasing well as expected, but after training for 20 hours, when I did the inference on test images, the network appears to have overfitted on the training data, because generated captions are not related with the test images at all. I repeated the inference with the model trained after every epoch, and it still performs unsatisfactorily. Thus, I decreased the embedding size to **256** and trained again, this times for only 1 epoch. The network performs great this time!\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I left the `transform_train` as the default value, because I think it's a good choice for my CNN architecture. In the original [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf) paper, which resnet architecture that my CNN encoder uses, scales shorter edge of images to 256, randomly crops it at 224, randomly samples and horizontally flips the images, and performs batch normalization. Thus, to keep the best performance of the original ResNet model, it makes the most sense to keep the image preprocessing and transforms the same as the original model. Thus, the default `transform_train` is choosen:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "transform_train = transforms.Compose([ \n",
    "    transforms.Resize(256),                          # smaller edge of image resized to 256\n",
    "    transforms.RandomCrop(224),                      # get 224x224 crop from random location\n",
    "    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),               # horizontally flip image with probability=0.5\n",
    "    transforms.ToTensor(),                           # convert the PIL Image to a tensor\n",
    "    transforms.Normalize((0.485, 0.456, 0.406),      # normalize image for pre-trained model\n",
    "                         (0.229, 0.224, 0.225))])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I decided to freeze all but the last layer of ResNet, because it's already pre-trained on ResNet and performs well. We can still fine tune the entire ResNet for better performance, but since ResNet is kind of big and deep architecture with a lot of parameters, freezing them makes my training faster, as the RNN decoder is already slow to train. Emperical results suggest that the pre-trained ResNet indeed does a good job. Since last layer of CNN encoder is used to transform the CNN feature map to something that RNN needs, it makes sense to train the last new fully connected layer from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "The RNN decoder is completely new, not a part of the pre-trained ResNet, so I also train all the parameters inside the RNN decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I chose the Adam optimier because it is one of the most popular and effective optimizers. It combines the benefits of weight decay, momentum, and many other optimization tricks altogether, so I usually default uses Adam optimizer."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
